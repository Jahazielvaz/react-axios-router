EXPERIENCE

I believe that a man should do what he considers to be great work, and not just highly paid work. I’m not satisfied unless I feel that I’m truly helping to shape and change the world for the better! I don’t believe in trading time for money, but rather in working for an amazing cause! I love software engineering because I feel that it could give me the skills I need to transform all my amazing ideas for this world, into reality!
